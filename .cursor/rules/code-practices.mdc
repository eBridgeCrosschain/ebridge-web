# Coding Best Practices
Iterate until the implementation adheres to the following:
- SOLID principles
- Add logging at important checkpoints of the code
- Ensure scalability and performance

Whenever `dotnet build` or `dotnet run` is executed, fix the compile error if there are any.
When referencing code, make sure that the referenced code exists.
