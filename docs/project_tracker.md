## Development Flow

1. Features start in the "Planned Tasks" section with @🔜 status
2. When development begins, they move to "Task Tracking" with @🚧 status
3. After completion, features are marked as @✅ and eventually @🚀 when released
4. Features with issues are marked as @❌ until resolved

## Development Standards

- Code must have at least 80% test coverage
- All features must be reviewed by at least one team member
- Documentation must be updated with each feature

- Conventional commit message format must be used
- Branch naming convention: feature/name, fix/name, hotfix/name

## Notes
- All dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Coverage should be updated after each major change
- Task IDs should follow the format: FEAT-001, BUG-001, etc.
- Branch names should follow: feature/name, hotfix/name, etc.
