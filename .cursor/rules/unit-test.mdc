# Unit Test Writing Specifications

- Use the Vitest framework34.

- Coverage must reach 90% or above, with necessary English comments for explanation12.

- There's no need to read and analyze imported content; mock the imported content instead5.

- After generating unit tests, execute yarn test:not-watch + file path in the root directory to run the tests, check for issues and coverage, and automatically fix any problems if found3.

- If unit tests execute successfully but show 0% coverage, try modifying Vitest's configuration file to enable output of unit test coverage reports6.
